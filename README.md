# Neovim-Environment-File

### my setup file for CP, specially suited for competitive programming and languages - C++,python,java,javascript,C

#### Add the file to ~/.config/nvim/ folder
#### Prereqs for neovim - git, python3, python2, gcc/clang, nodejs, pip-(neovim,pynvim), npm-(neovim), fonts, vimPlug
You can run :checkhealth from inside nvim to see if everything's okay.

#### Steps
1. Make changes in the file ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
2. Run :PlugInstall from within nvim
3. Restart nvim

If all dependencies are met, the environment should be up :)

P.S. - I wasn't using version control system for my personal setup file before sep2020, hence the history folder. I'll be making latest changes to my setup file public from now on.
